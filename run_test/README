TODO: need to modify 
In this directory:
	./fuzz/
		updated fuzz.c and python script to generate test data
	./pty/
		updated cross-platform ptyjig and some end of interactive tools
	./test_Linux/
		name and option pools of each cmd to be tested on Linux
	./test_MacOS/
		name and option pools of each cmd to be tested on MacOS
	./test_FreeBSD/
		name and option pools of each cmd to be tested on FreeBSD

	run.py
		automatically test all utilities listed in a file(see ./test_Linux/ or ./test_MacOS/ or ./test_FreeBSD/)
		One can edit run.py to specify all the settings
		The default setting is:
			test on small test cases
			timeout after 300 seconds
			utility names and options pools are from "./test_Linux/run.master_options"
			test result of each utility will be saved into "./log", each utility corresponds to a result file
			the script will combine result files into single file named "all"

In this directory:
	ptyjig_cross_platform.c: 
		modified ptyjig
	end/:
		end of different interactive utilities, such as vim, ftp, csh, htop and so on
	t1:
		a small test case
	test_case_for_vim:
		a sample test case for vim. To test vim, just run:
		./pty -d 0.05 vim < test_case_for_vim

		One can generate a test case for other interactive utilities by append end file to t1:
			cat t1 ./end/end_htop > test_case_for_htop
			./pty -d 0.05 htop < test_case_for_htop
		run.py will automatically concatenate the test case and the specific end before testing a utility
