NAME
     run.py - automated tool for fuzz testing

SYNOPSIS
     python run.py config_file [-i [test_dir]] [-o [result_dir]] [options] ...

DESCRIPTION
     The main purpose of run.py is to automate the testing of utilities using 
     test files generated by fuzz. We use config_file to specify the utilities 
     to be tested and the type of input each utility takes. The files 
     in test_dir are then fed into each utility in config_file and the results 
     are stored in result_dir. If the retun value of the utility is >= 126 or 
     < 0, an error is recorded in the result file as well as the test file that 
     causes the error. If the test does not finish in 5 minutes, a hang is 
     recorded together with the test file that causes the hang.

     config_file

         Specify the type of input fed into each utility using the following 
         syntax:

         [stdin|file|cp|two_files|pty] [utility_name] [options]

         stdin      Extract the content from the test file and feed into the 
                    utility.

         file       Feed the file name directly to the utility.

         cp         Copy the content of test file to a temporary file with 
                    the correct appendix in the file name.

         two_files  Feed two files into the utility.

         pty        Test the utility using ptyjig. To use ptyjig, a temporary 
                    file is created for each test file and then fed into the 
                    utility. In the temporary file, we filter out characters 
                    that will suspend the process and append the corresponding 
                    end to ensure proper quit. 

         options    Add the options required for the utility to take input.

     -i [test_dir]
         Specify the directory which contains test files to be fed into the 
         utilities.

     -o [result_dir]
         Specify the directory to store the testing results.

     The following options can be specified.

     -p [prefix]
         Specify the prefix of test files to be used. 

     -t [time_out]
         Specify the timeout for each test. The default time out is 5 minutes.
