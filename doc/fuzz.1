       The main purpose of _f_u_z_z is to test the robustness of system utilities.
       We use _f_u_z_z to generate random characters. These are then  piped  to  a
       system utility (using _p_t_y_j_i_g_(_1_) if necessary.)  If the utility crashes,
       the saved input and output streams can then be analyzed to decide  what
       sorts of input cause problems.

       _L_e_n_g_t_h  is  taken  to  be  the  length of the output stream, usually in
       bytes, When --ll is selected it the length is in number of strings.

       The following options can be specified.

       --00     Include NULL (ASCII 0) characters

       --aa     Include all ASCII characters except NULL (default)

       --dd _d_e_l_a_y
              Specify a delay in seconds between each character.

       --ee _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Send _s_t_r_i_n_g after all the characters. This feature can  be  used
              to  send  termination  strings  to the test programs. Standard C
              escape sequences can be used.

       --ll _[_l_e_n_]
              Generate random length strings.  If  _l_e_n  is  specified,  it  is
              taken  to  be the maximum length of each string (default = 255).
              Strings are terminated with the ASCII newline character.

       --oo _f_i_l_e
              Store the output stream to _f_i_l_e as well as sending them to  _s_t_d_-
              _o_u_t.

       --pp     Generate printable ASCII characters only

       --rr _f_i_l_e
              Replay characters stored in _f_i_l_e.

       --ss _s_e_e_d
              Use _s_e_e_d as the seed to the random number generator.

       --mm _m_o_d_u_l_u_s
              Use  _m_o_d_u_l_u_s  to restrict the range of random seed to 0 to _m_o_d_u_-
              _l_u_s_-_1.

       --xx     Print the seed as the first line of stdout.
